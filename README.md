# Orbit Launcher
This is a launcher developed from scratch in December 2013. It was unable to launch the game until end of 2014 though.

It launch Minecraft aproximately 200k times.
There was some years that I don't work on this anymore so I upload it to GitHub.
There are things that were almost finished like the mod system but never came to the light.

If you want to execute the launcher use the updater from here https://github.com/mlomb/orbit-launcher-updater or add a default argument with the working directory of the launcher.

### Some pictures
